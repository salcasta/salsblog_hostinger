## Morning

- Went to the gym at 8AM
- Did cardio for 30 min
	- 15min/mile
	- 10% incline
- I did chest and biceps
	- I tried out standing cable chest flys

I felt really good. I will definitely add this exercise to my rotation

## Afternoon 

- Continued my reading of "S.P.Q.R"

I need to create another site with my findings of the Roman Empire from this book!

- Looking to get into more hobbies

I am feeling drone flying, a great way to incorporate video editing. DJI has so many different drone at different price points. The time to get in is now and start small.
